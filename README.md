Introducing the “Employee Happiness Tracking Tool” or EHTT, to speed things up.
EHTT, is an application that helps the user track the level of happiness of people related to their company.

Each person will have the following properties:

- Name
- Category
- Company Name
- Happiness level

We want it to list people and allow you to search for them by name or category. The results should include the possibility of sorting them by happiness level, category or company in ascending or descending order.
